# Data-Preprocessing
I have performed data preprocessing on various features, including feature selection using a variety of methods, outlier removal, and handling skewness and kurtosis. I have used all available methods to address each of these issues.

Feature Selection: Used a variety of methods, including correlation analysis, Chi-square, SelectKBest etc feature importance to select the most relevant features for the project.
Outlier Removal: Identified and removed outliers using methods such as interquartile range (IQR) filtering and Z-score filtering etc.
Skewness and Kurtosis Handling: Used methods such as log transformation, sqrt transformation, Box-Cox transformation etc to handle skewness and kurtosis in the data.
